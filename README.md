"Disable my plugin" is a Wordpress plugin that allows you to deactivate other plugins during a range of time every day. For example it could be used for closing a contact plugin outside the opening hours of your business.

IMPORTANT: That's a "Must Use Plugin". That's because it needs to have a higher priority than the other plugins in order to deactivating them. You can find more information on this link https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins

I will be updating the plugin to add more functionalities in the future. If you have any idea, just let me know!
